<h1>
    The "new normal" and remote work
</h1>

<p>
During COVID times most of us changed our way of working. 
</p>
<p>
Companies had to allow remote working and in most cases, business went on as usual, if not better. 
</p>
<p>
A lot of people changed jobs and started working at new places, sometimes too far away of their homes.
</p>
<p>
Now that the pandemic is hopefully ending, some companies accepted remote work as something to stay and others are eager to return to the office.
</p>
