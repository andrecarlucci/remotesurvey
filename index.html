            The "new normal" and remote work
        </h1>

        <p>
            During COVID times most of us changed our way of working.
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies had to allow remote working and in most cases, business went on as usual, if not better.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of people changed jobs and started working at new places, sometimes too far away of their homes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that the pandemic is hopefully ending, some companies accepted remote work as something to stay and
            others are eager to return to the office.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>What will you do about it?</b>
